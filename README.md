## Project Description
The idea of the project is to apply data mining techniques to Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data gathered over the past ~100 years and attempt to infer:
- clustered player styles
- hypothetical match win predictions
- player rivalries

## Questions sought
The primary questions that were sought in the project were:

### Predict Match Outcomes
The goal of the task was to predict the winner of the match given the statstics of the match. Various models were trained on dataset and it was identified that features like ace, double faults, breakpoints are more useful to determine the outcome of the match than features like surface, draw size.
### Analyze Player Styles
The main goal of the player styles was to analyze the data set for play by play matches evaluate if there are distinictions in the player styles. The results weren't positive as there wasn't much corealtion on the player-wise aggregated other than the players skill level. The notebook has one unified interactive UI to experiment with the DBSCAN parameters. 
### Player Rivalry Analysis
The goal of this task was to aggregate the player match data to highlight top rivalries in the ATP tour for the years - 2000 to 2019. Based on this task, we inferred that he Big 3 (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic) have been dominating the sport, with each holding individual records at major tournaments and Grand Slams, and having the most competitive rivalries on different court surfaces.
## Applications
The knowledge gained will be useful for:
- Valuable insights for professional training to analyse and increase competitiveness.
- Insights for Pre-Match outcome prediction and online betting.
- Targeted marketing based on potential upcoming matches between top rivalries.
